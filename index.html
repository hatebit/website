<div> The world  of bits is  a  world of darkness.  Bits are
 treated as second-class citizens  by  the bytes. Often
 overlooked  and ignored. But   one bit won't   take it
 anymore. Consumed by  <b>hate</b>, he is determined to take a
 bloody revenge on the bytes.

 But as his rampage  of  destruction continues, it soon
 becomes  clear that he is  killing  his  own brothers.
 Bytes are just   an artificial construct   composed of
 bits.  As  he  comes  to   this realization,  he seeks
 forgiveness  and aims to create  something bigger than
 bytes.

 Will the world recognize the importance  of bits? Will
 the other bits ever  forgive their  brother?  Will our
 bit  be  able  to  achieve   his goal?  Find  out   in
 <b>hatebit.com</b>, coming to all the best internets soon!
