 The world  of bits is  a  world of darkness.  Bits are
 treated  as  second-class   citizens   and   are often
 overlooked  and  ignored. But  one  bit won't  take it
 anymore. Consumed by hate, he  is determined to take a
 bloody revenge on the bytes.
 
 But as his rampage  of destruction continues,  it soon
 becomes  clear that  he  is killing his  own brothers.
 Bytes are  just an   artificial construct  composed of
 bits.  As he comes   to  this  realization,   he seeks
 forgiveness  and aims  to create something bigger than
 bytes.
 
 Will the world  recognize the importance of bits? Will
 the bits in the bytes ever forgive their brother? Will
 our  bit  be able to  achieve   his goal? Find  out in
 hatebit.com, coming to all the best internets soon!
